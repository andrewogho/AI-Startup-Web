## Clone the Repository

1. **Copy the Repository URL**:
   - On the repository page, click the "Code" button.
   - Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://github.com/andrewogho/AI-Startup-Web.git`).
)

2. **Clone the Repository Locally**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Create a folder named `Git_project` in your desired location:
     ```bash
     mkdir Git_project
     ```
   - Navigate into the `Andrewpersonal` folder:
     ```bash
     cd Andrewpersonal
     ```
   - Clone the repository using the copied URL:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/andrewogho/AI-Startup-Web.git
     ```
   - Navigate into the cloned repository:
     ```bash
     cd AI-Startup-Web
     ```

## Make Changes and Commit

1. **Create a New File**:
   - Create an empty `index.html` file:
     ```bash
     touch index.html
     ```
   - Add some content to the file using a text editor or IDE.

2. **Check Git Status**:
   - Run the following command to see the changes that have not been staged:
     ```bash
     git status
     ```

3. **Stage Changes**:
   - Stage all changes for commit:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
![git status command ran](9.Push_to_remote.png)     

4. **Commit Changes**:
   - Commit the changes with a message:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "clear message here"
     ```
![git status command ran](9.Push_to_remote.png)

## Push Changes to GitHub

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   - Push the changes to the `main` branch on GitHub:
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```

# PART 2: Simulating Tom and Jerry's Work

This guide will walk you through the basics of using GitHub, including navigating a project directory, creating branches, making changes, and collaborating with others. We'll simulate workflows for two contributors, Tom and Jerry.

---

## Navigating the Project Directory and Checking Branches

### Steps:
1. **Navigate to the project directory** you just cloned using the command:
   ```bash
   cd ai-startup-web
   ```

2. **Check the current branch in the repository** using:
   ```bash
   git branch
   ```

   This will display all the branches in the repository.

3. **Create a new branch called `update-navigation`:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b update-navigation
   ```

4. **Verify the new branch** by running `git branch` again. You should see the newly created branch listed.

---

## Making Changes and Staging Them

### Steps:
1. Open the `index.html` file in your code editor. Since this file already exists in the main branch, it will also exist in the new branch you created.




2. **Check the status of your changes** using:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

   This will show that the changes have not been staged yet.

4. **Stage the changes** using:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

5. **Confirm the staged changes** by running `git status` again. The changes should now be staged and ready to commit.

## Committing and Pushing Changes

### Steps:
1. **Commit the changes** with a meaningful message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "update navigation bar"
   ```
   ![Git Status](9.Push_to_remote.png)

2. **Push the branch to GitHub** using:
   ```bash
   git push origin update-navigation
   ```

## Simulating Jerry's Contribution

### Steps:
1. **Switch back to the main branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. **Create a new branch for Jerry called `add-contact-info`:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b add-contact-info
   ```

3. Make the necessary changes to the project (e.g., adding contact information to `index.html`).

4. **Stage, commit, and push Jerry's changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "add contact information"
   git push origin add-contact-info
   ```
